# event-horizon
Event Horizon is a 3D game similar to the classic Escape Velocity game from Ambrosia, but Event Horizon has a first-person view style. Basic game play is very similar: you fly around the galaxy in your spaceship, landing on planets to trade goods or get missions, and buy or sell spaceship addons or another spaceship.
