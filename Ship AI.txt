=================================

FLEETS
Fleets have three strategies to attack their enemies: gang up on least threatening,
most threatening, or try to match evenly. The choice is determined by the fleet leader,
which may base it's choice on various parameters.

When unattached combat vehicles jump into a system, they are assigned to a default fleet,
one per government, which is owned by the highest ranking vessel in the fleet. That
vessel determines the attack strategy, and may also issue a retreat command.

The leader of a fleet that jumps into a system may register with the default fleet or not,
at its discretion.
